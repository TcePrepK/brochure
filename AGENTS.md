# CLAUDE.md — Brochure

## Session start
Read these files at the beginning of every session:
- `~/.claude/shared/task-workflow.md`
- `~/.claude/shared/synopsis.md`
- `~/.claude/shared/rust-conventions.md`

---

## Keeping This File Current

**Update AGENTS.md whenever you:**

- Add, rename, or restructure a module or directory
- Change a module's sole responsibility
- Add a new persisted type or data file
- Add or change a script in `scripts/`
- Change the testing workflow
- Establish a new non-negotiable rule
- **Change the task workflow**

**Do not let AGENTS.md drift from the code.** If you notice a stale reference (wrong file path, removed type, changed
rule), fix it in the same commit.

---

## Code Quality (non-negotiable, apply on every edit)

Whenever you read or edit a file — even for a small fix — also look for:

- **Duplicate or near-duplicate code** that belongs in a shared helper function.
- **Functions that are too long** and would be clearer if split into smaller, focused helpers.
- **Files that have grown too large** and would benefit from being split into sub-modules.
- **Obvious simplifications**: dead branches, redundant variables, needlessly verbose patterns.

Make these improvements in the same commit when they are clearly better and low-risk.
When the improvement is larger or uncertain, surface it to the user as a suggestion.

## Git Commit Conventions

Use the `<type>: <lowercase description>` format:

| Type     | When to use                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `feat:`  | New user-facing feature              |
| `fix:`   | Bug fix                              |
| `chore:` | Maintenance (deps, git, CI, etc.)    |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring with no functional change |
| `docs:`  | Documentation-only changes           |
| `test:`  | Adding or updating tests             |

**When refactoring**, split changes into focused commits — one per logical concern:
- `refactor: replace cursor macros with composable functions`
- `refactor: extract shared http_get_bytes helper, fix clippy warning`
- `refactor: add shared now_secs() timestamp helper`
- `refactor: consolidate ratatui imports, extract tree-drawing helpers`
- `refactor: deduplicate article handler read/toggle functions`
- `refactor: extract feed-list refresh helpers`
- `refactor: convert settings Left/Right if-chains to match arms`
- `refactor: use split_cursor utility in saved-category editor`

**Guidelines:**
- One file appears in at most one commit in a batch
- Each commit compiles on its own (when possible)
- Subject line is 72 chars or fewer
- Do not use `-i`/interactive flags (`rebase -i`, `add -i`, `add -p`)
